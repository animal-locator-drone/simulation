# UEAssets

- This folder contains assets such as 3D models, blueprints, code for Unreal Engine 5 for use with our simulation. 
- Dog.uasset
        - This is an asset of a dog that also has a trigger to send an http request to detection-service 
- httpTst.*
        - These files are the blueprint data for the http request but they cannot be imported trivially therefore we now have Dog.uasset
